# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

users = User.create ([
{
  name: "Santiago"
}
{
  name: "Betsy"
}
{
  name: "Grace"

{
  name: "Ulbby"

{
  name: "Santiago Sr."
}
{
  name: "Leonardo"
}
{
  name: "Maribel"

{
  name: "Aliani"
